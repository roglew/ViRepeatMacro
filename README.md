Sublime Text Repeat Last Vi Macro
=================================

This is a plugin that allows for you to repeat the last Vintage mode macro that you performed. I created this plugin because I am getting a bit tired of vim and wanted to try something new, but Sublime Text was missing this one feature that I absolutely needed from vim.
