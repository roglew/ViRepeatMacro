Sublime Text Repeat Last Vi Macro
=================================

Description
-----------
This is a plugin that allows for you to repeat the last Vintage mode macro that you performed. I created this plugin because I am getting a bit tired of vim and wanted to try something new, but Sublime Text was missing this one feature that I absolutely needed from vim.

Installation
------------
Click the "Download zip" button at the top. Extract the zip file, and copy the folder into your <Sublime Folder>/Packages/ folder. If you have git, you can do:

Linux:
	cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages
	git clone git@github.com:roglew/ViRepeatMacro.git

Mac/OSX:
	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
	git clone git@github.com:roglew/ViRepeatMacro.git

How to Use
----------
Make a macro in Vintage mode using Q. Then use the macro once normally. Then while in command mode, press Shift+Space to repeat the macro.
